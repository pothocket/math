\begin{problem}{4.1}
    Composition is defined for \textit{two} morphisms. 
    If more than two morphisms are given, e.g.:

    \[\begin{tikzcd}
        A \ar[r,"f"] & B \ar[r,"g"] & C \ar[r,"h"] & D \ar[r,"i"] & E
    \end{tikzcd}\]

    then one may compose them in several ways, for example:
    \begin{equation*}
        (ih)(gf),\,\,\,\, (i(hg))f,\,\,\,\, i((hg)f),\,\,\,\, etc.
    \end{equation*}
    so that at every step one is only composing two morphisms. 
    Prove that the result of any such nested composition is independent of the placement of the parentheses.
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
  We will use induction on the number of morphisms being composed, which we will denote as $n$.\\
  Base case: Suppose $n=3$. 
  Then, since C is a category, we have $f_1(f_2f_3)$ = $(f_1f_2)f_3$.\\
  Induction: Suppose that all groupings of $f_1,\, \ldots\, f_{n-1}$ are equivalent.
  Then, let $\alpha=$
\end{solution}
